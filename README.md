it's fully inspired by strawberry milk & sakura seasons! 🍓🥛

### ✨ features
*   **pastel palette:** soft pinks, lavender, and warm whites.
*   **glassmorphism:** menus look like frosted glass (so aesthetic).
*   **tasty text:** changed the font colors to a warm cocoa brown so it's very tasty.
*   **round everything:** everything is rounded and soft.
